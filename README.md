# Priority Task Scheduler (C, Heap / Priority Queue)

A simple yet powerful **command-line task manager** built in **C**, using a **Min-Heap (Priority Queue)** data structure to schedule and complete tasks based on their **priority and deadlines**.

This project demonstrates practical use of **data structures and algorithms (DSA)** concepts — especially heaps, dynamic arrays, and sorting — implemented entirely from scratch in C.

---

## Features

**Data Structure:**

- Implements a **Min-Heap / Priority Queue** using a dynamic array.
- Insertions and deletions maintain the heap property in **O(log n)** time.

**Task Management:**

- Add new tasks with description, priority, and optional deadline.
- View, complete, or list tasks in ascending order of priority.
- Save and load all tasks from a `.csv` file for persistence.

**Command-Line Interface:**

- Intuitive text-based interaction.
- Lightweight, portable, and fully written in C.

⚙️ Build Instructions
Make sure you have gcc installed. (On macOS, it’s included with Xcode Command Line Tools.)

```bash
make
```

Run

```bash
./scheduler
```

You should see:

```text
Priority Task Scheduler — type 'help' for commands.

Commands

```text
Command	                             Description
add "<desc>" <priority> <deadline>	Adds a new task (deadline optional)
pop	                                Removes and prints the highest-priority task
peek	                            Shows the next task without removing it
list	                            Displays all pending tasks (sorted by priority)
save <file.csv>	                    Saves all tasks to a CSV file
load <file.csv>	                    Loads tasks from a CSV file (merges if exists)
clear	                            Deletes all tasks
help	                            Displays command help
quit	                            Exits the program
```

 3. [3] 2025-10-12   Write report

> pop
Completed: "Fix login bug" (priority 1, deadline 2025-10-10)
> save tasks.csv
Saved tasks to tasks.csv
> clear
Cleared all tasks.
> load tasks.csv

Data Structure Overview

```c
typedef struct {
    char desc[128];
    int  priority;       // smaller = higher priority
    char deadline[32];
} Task;
```

Heap Structure

```c
typedef struct {
    Task* arr;
    int size;
    int capacity;
} Heap;
```

Time Complexities

```text
Operation	Complexity
Insert	O(log n)
Delete / Pop	O(log n)
Peek	O(1)
Build Heap	O(n)
List All (sorted)	O(n log n)
```
